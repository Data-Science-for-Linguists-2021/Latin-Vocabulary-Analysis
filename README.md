# Latin-Vocabulary-Analysis
<p>Frances Harrington, frh19@pitt.edu, 5/2/2021</p>
<p>Frances Harrington's term project about the analysis of the frequency and context of Latin words for "sword" in primary documents.</p>
<p>My data comes from the [Latin Library website](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/) long mainted by William L. Carey. I did not find this data set recently, this is a resource that I've used since high school to read texts in Latin. It contains a multitude of works in the original Latin.</p>
