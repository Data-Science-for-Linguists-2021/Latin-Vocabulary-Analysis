### A working title:
“Usages of Military Vocabulary in Latin Texts”

### A brief summary:
There are a few different words for “sword” in Latin, using the texts available on the Latin Library website (https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/), I want to find the instances of these words, then see the context they’re used in (text title, author, verse/prose, genre). Is one word used more than the others based on context? What effect does the necessity of metric conformity have on word choice?

### The DATA portion:
The data will be in a chart that displays each word for sword, how many times it appears overall, and what texts it appears in. The words that I will be searching for are: gladius, ferrum, mucro, ensis, and capulus. Also will be the texts of the works that are being searched and the relevant information (title, author, verse/prose, genre). This will involve scraping the text content from the site as each work is not a downloadable file, but rather just text displayed on the webpage. I will be aiming to download at least one full work from each author represented on the site in order to get a good mixture of data from different styles, genres, and eras of writing. I will get my data from Latin Library website.

### The ANALYSIS portion:
My end goal is to discover which of the Latin words for “sword” is most commonly used and is it used more often in some instances rather than others? What are the conditions that might affect that usage. I hypothesize that “gladius” will be the most commonly used word out of all of the words overall, but “ferrum” will be most common in poetry. I have this hypothesis based on past readings that I’ve done in my Latin courses.

### The PRESENTATION portion:
For this I just plan on a google slides presentation with my data and analysis included.
